# Microgrid-Project01

**Energy Data Exploration & Visualization**

Microgrid-Project01 is an open-source Python project that focuses on **load and renewable generation analysis**, offering interactive dashboards, reproducible pipelines, and automated reports.

---

## Project Overview

The project analyzes microgrid datasets — typically time-series measurements of load (consumption) and generation (solar PV, wind, etc.) — to uncover energy patterns and insights such as:

- Daily and weekly load vs. generation profiles
- Peak and off-peak behavior
- Renewable utilization and self-consumption rates
- Excess renewable vs. grid import periods
- Key summary statistics and visual narratives

Version 1 (v1) focuses purely on **dataset-only analysis** without weather or pricing data.
Future versions (v2+) will progressively add forecasting, optimization, and blockchain-based energy trading simulations.
